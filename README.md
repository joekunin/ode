Ode
===

Tile-based role-playing game written in Elm. Mostly to allow me to goof around with Elm.

To run it, you'll need to [install Elm](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm) first. Then

    $ git clone git@github.com:williewheeler/elm.git
    $ cd ode
    $ elm-reactor

Finally point your browser at

    http://localhost:8000/Main.elm

At the moment, this "game" doesn't do much beyond rendering tiles and letting the player walk around.
